- I'd like to move from giu library to just use imgui-go directly
- How to make scrollbars in Giu?
  make 2 rectangles on the side, use proper imgui theme (lol)
  have some api using an int64-range
  notify the user of the visible range, let the user print its lines from line 0, to line 'numvisible'.
  i.e. this 'breaks' the very big canvas to scroll idea that the normal scrollbar uses
  on purpose - the very big canvas gets lots of floating point drift after some lines.
- How to do dynamic loading in Go? I.e. a standard plugin system would load a dll, then
  the dll could register itself with the program in the 'init' function.
  there is the 'plugin' package in the standard library. Problem solved. (doesn't work on windows)
- See the list in the readme for TODO-features
- Buffers that reference portion of a file-on-disk should be read into memory if a save operation
  will touch those portions on disk (!important!! BUG)
